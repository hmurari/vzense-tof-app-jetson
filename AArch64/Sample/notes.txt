Internal work items.
- Debug and fix why local time and utc time are coming out to be same value.
- Print a header message (Terminal)(Starting ToF Application, Header fields, Logs)
- Print to a log file (Duplicate of whatever we print on terminal) (say /var/log/tof-output.log, add a config constant for this file name.)
- Print to a CSV file (only header & required data). CSV File should be refreshed every hour. (Filename: /var/log/tof/2021-02-01-12-30.csv). Create a new CSV file every hour.
- Implement log rotation (use some existing log location mechanism like https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/source/src/util/logrotate.cpp)




Harsh to  take care of this --> Maybe through a cron job?
- Cleanup old log & CSV files > 2 days old. (Log rotation).


For VZense/Longer term work items:
- Automatically calibrate the sensor. Figure out static distances and figure it out.
- Accuracy improvements
